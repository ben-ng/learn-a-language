# learn-a-thing

I started this repo because I had to learn a bunch of new stuff in a matter of weeks.

The problems are simple enough that they can often be solved in under an hour, but yield a useful product. They also emphasize practical programming skills, not CS theory.

I try to use as much of the language/technology as possible in my solutions to maximize learning speed. The goal is to write simple, understandable, idiomatic solutions. Performance and elegance are secondary concerns.
